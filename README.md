Implementing the various sort algorithms described in Thomas H. Cormen's 'Algorithms Unlocked'. As with my [implementations of search algorithms from this book](https://github.com/nathanielltaylor/algorithms-unlocked-searching), these examples are written to favor clarity and ease of portability to other languages in mind over Ruby best practices and language-specific shortcuts.

The insertion sort is, on average, 2 to 3 times faster than the selection sort.
